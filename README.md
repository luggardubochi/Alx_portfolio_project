# Introduction

The software Lito Music Player was created with fulfillment in mind. This project was selected due to its ease of completion in a short amount of time and simplicity. It was constructed by my team and I under the able direction of Samarpan's explanation and directions. This project, which was created using Python, examines the use of several of the language's libraries, including tkinter, tinytag, mutagen, and others. The use of APIs, which were employed to extract musical lyrics, is also explored. The wonderful folks in my group were an enormous motivator as well.

### üéØ <u>***_Module That you have to Install Manually:-_***</u>
### 1. ***_Pillow_***

Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving images. The current version identifies and reads a large number of formats. Write support is intentionally restricted to the most commonly used interchange and presentation formats.


#### üéØ Install Pillow by writing `pip install pillow` in your ***cmd or Terminal***
üéØ 
[To see Pillow Documentation Click Here](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

### 2. ***_Pygame_***

Pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.

#### üéØ Install Pygame by writing `pip install pygame` in your ***cmd or Terminal***
üéØ 
[To see Pygame Documentation Click Here](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

### 3. ***_Mutagen_***

Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports ASF, FLAC, MP4, Monkey‚Äôs Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG, and AIFF audio files. All versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams on an individual packet/page level.

#### üéØ Install Mutagen by writing `pip install mutagen` in your ***cmd or Terminal***

# Set Up and running of the software
### Running the software 
1. Create a virtual environment by running 
``` virtualenv <env_name> ```
2. Activate the virtualenv to avoid tampering with your python dependencies
``` <env_name>/Scripts/activate ```
3. Step three is to install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file  
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Final step is running the software
``` ./music_player_app.py ```
### Generating the Execuatable of the software
1. Create a virtual environment by running 
``` virtualenv <env_name> ```
2. Activate the virtualenv to avoid tampering with your python dependencies
``` <env_name>/Scripts/activate ```
3. Step three is to install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file  
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Generate the executable
``` pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed ```
5. A folder will automatically appear. The folder will contain the already produced executable.
6. Open the folder and use the executable
